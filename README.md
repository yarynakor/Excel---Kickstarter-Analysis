# Excel- Kickstarter Analysis 

In this task I am using the Excel table, modifying and analyzing the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects to uncover some market trends.

Using conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.

Creating a new column O called Percent Funded that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.

Using conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.

Creating a new column P called Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

Creating two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.
